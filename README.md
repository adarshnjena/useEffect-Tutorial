## What is useEffect?

`useEffect` is a React Hook that lets you perform side effects in function components. Side effects are operations that interact with the outside world, such as:

- Data fetching
- Setting up subscriptions
- Manually changing the DOM
- Setting up timers
- Logging

### Basic Syntax

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Your effect code here
  
  return () => {
    // Cleanup code here (optional)
  };
}, [dependencies]); // Dependency array
```

## The Cooking Timer Example

Our cooking timer demonstrates several key aspects of `useEffect`:

1. **Setting up a timer** - Using `setInterval` inside `useEffect`
2. **Cleaning up** - Clearing the interval when the component unmounts
3. **Conditional effects** - Only running the effect when certain state changes
4. **Dependency array** - Controlling when the effect runs

### How to Run the Example

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Run `npm start`
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser
4. Click the Start button to begin the timer
5. Use Pause to stop the timer
6. Use Reset to set the timer back to 0

## Key Concepts

### 1. Running Effects After Render

`useEffect` runs after the render is committed to the screen. This means your component will render first, and then the effect will run.

### 2. The Dependency Array

The second argument to `useEffect` is an array of dependencies. This array tells React when to re-run the effect:

- `[]` - Run once after the initial render (like `componentDidMount`)
- `[value]` - Run when `value` changes
- No array - Run after every render (use with caution!)

### 3. Cleanup Function

If your effect returns a function, React will run it when it's time to clean up. This is where you should clean up any subscriptions, timers, or event listeners.

## Common Use Cases

1. **Data Fetching**
   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     const fetchData = async () => {
       const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
       const data = await response.json();
       setData(data);
     };
     
     fetchData();
   }, []);
   ```

2. **Event Listeners**
   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     const handleResize = () => {
       setWindowSize(window.innerWidth);
     };
     
     window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
     return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
   }, []);
   ```

3. **Document Title Updates**
   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
   }, [count]);
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Always include dependencies** - If your effect uses props or state, include them in the dependency array
2. **Clean up after yourself** - Always return a cleanup function if your effect creates resources that need to be cleaned up
3. **Split concerns** - Use multiple effects to separate unrelated logic
4. **Move functions inside effects** - If a function is only used in an effect, define it inside the effect
5. **Use the ESLint plugin** - The `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` package helps catch common mistakes

## Troubleshooting

### My effect runs in an infinite loop
This usually happens when you're setting state in your effect without the proper dependency array, or when your effect updates a value that's in its dependency array.

### My cleanup function runs on every render
This is normal! The cleanup function runs before the effect runs again. If you only want to clean up when the component unmounts, use an empty dependency array `[]`.

### I'm getting stale state in my effect
If you're seeing stale state in your effect, make sure to include all the state variables your effect depends on in the dependency array. If you need to use the latest state in a callback, use the functional update form of the state setter.

## Conclusion

`useEffect` is a powerful hook that lets you handle side effects in your React components. The cooking timer example demonstrates how to manage timers, which is just one of many use cases for `useEffect`. Remember to always clean up after your effects to prevent memory leaks and unexpected behavior.
